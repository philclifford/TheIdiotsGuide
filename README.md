TIG might become a GIT user's resource with a little practice and maybe some collaboration

## First there was a blank page

Here would be a good place to start adding some ideas for Sections and/or Goals.

Maybe a list of objectives and use-cases...

Plus some [code](hello_world.sh)

## Project Management

You might have tooling for this or you may prefer to use the facilties of Github or GitLab along with your preferred
dev tools / IDE to accomplish some appropriate level of structure

## Testing

Is good, and should be automated

## CI/CD

see Testing ...
